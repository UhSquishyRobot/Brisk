â€º Run the previous chapter's code through gdb and crash it. See what happens.

Program received signal SIGFPE, Arithmetic exception.

How do you give an enum a name?
enum State {Working = 1, Failed = 0}

What are union data types and how do they work?
A union data type can store a value of several different types, but only one at a time.
For instance, the following union type

union Example {
    int num;
    char character;
    char string[20];
}

can contain EITHER an int, a character, or a 20 byte string.  It will take up as much memory
as its largets possible member (in this case 20 bytes), even if it does not hold such a value.

What are the advantages over using a union instead of struct?
Mostly saves memory it seems like?
