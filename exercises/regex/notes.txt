I'm noticing that the 'explanation' notation I'm using to describe the regexes is sort of similar to the 
AST generated by the mpc library.

"The second field is contents. This will contain the actual contents of the node such as '*', '(' or '5'. You'll notice for branches this is empty, but for leaves we can use it to find the operator or number to use."

^This reminds me of when I was trying to decide how to organize things like 'then', 'either' in relation to the values they modified.
