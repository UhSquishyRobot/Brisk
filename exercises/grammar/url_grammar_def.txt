in 'valid_domain_char' \w is borrowed from RegEx to indicate that any alphanumeric character is a valid domain char

in 'domain' and 'url' (n) or (n:x) are used (vaguely borrowed from Python) to indicate that either:
(n) - exactly n instances of the type are required 
(n:x) - beween n and x instances of the type are required
253 is the maximum allowed length for a domain name

in 'domain' $ is borrowed from RegEx to indicate that the type must end with the character or string
this would likely require better syntax to be flexible.  if for instance, the word was required to end with one of a variety of characters or strings
